    <h2>A little about myself...</h2>
    <p>San Francisco born and raised, I grew up in a culture where we cherished
      our sports teams, whether they were winning or not. I am a huge basketball
      and baseball fan. I love fantasy sports and looking at stats and boxscores.
      I love listening to music and learning songs on my guitar. Currently, aspiring
      to learn piano as well. I am a huge flannel guy, and my favorite type of food
      is probably Japanese.

    <p>Hello! I'll be returning to UC Santa Cruz for my third year in the fall of 2018.
      I'm originally from San Francisco and I'm hoping to pursue a career in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
      Always eager and willing to develop new skills, and currently seeking internship opportunities.
